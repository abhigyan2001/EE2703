## Endsem:

This is obviously the End-Semester exam question paper, and it contains a lot of interesting code.

I had a lot of fun coding this one, and I learnt how to properly use numpy and reshaping through this.

Very interesting question, and I hope you learn something from it :)

(Also hope that this isn't your Endsem paper xD)
