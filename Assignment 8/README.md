## Assignment 8:

This assignment is based on the Digital Fourier Transform - of Periodic Signals.

You'll get to use a number of different functions from the `numpy.fft` and get to see the behaviour of the fft for a number of different signals.

Helps revise while learning DSP, and you get a real feeling for the subject of Signal Processing through this one.
