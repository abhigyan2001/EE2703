## Assignment 6:

This is also one of the coolest assignments in this course, and is arguably cooler than the previous one.

Here, you'll be simulating a tubelight using electrons and gas particles, and find the distribution of where you should be finding the maximas and the bright spots if you were to ever realise this tubelight in reality.

It's a ton of fun, and if you do the plotting correctly, you'll get a bunch of beautiful looking plots. I even used one of them as my Profile picture on WhatsApp for a while, it was so fun.
