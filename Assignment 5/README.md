## Assignment 5:

This is one of the coolest assignments in this course.

Here, you'll be simulating a metal plate that has current being supplied to it by a cylindrical rod onto its centre, and the plate is grounded at the bottom edge.

You need to calculate the direction of motion of the currents and the temperature gradient of the plate as it heats up.

Hope you find this one as interesting as I did :)
