# EE2703 - January-May 2021

If you feel that this repo was of any use to you, do consider starring it, at least as long as you're doing this course. It'll help others who might want help too, so think of it as a community service ;)

This course was actually one of the most enjoyable ones for me in the 4th semester of Electrical Engineering. Had a lot of fun doing this work. 

Hope you find what you seek, seeker of help and wisdom!

May the Fourth (Semester) be with You!

For those that seek counsel on how best to copy and make this your "own" code, I suggest reading code and copying it line by line instead of copy pasting it straight. It's highly unfortunate (you may think fortunate, but trust me, in the long run it won't be) that you have the same Assignments as we did, but since it's here anyway, and you've found this one now, I don't think I should stop you.

The reason why I tell you to copy and write code line by line is because you'll get an understanding of why you're doing what you're doing. 

It'll also provide you with an understanding of what to do when you're faced with a similar situation later. 

It's still copying, and there's no two ways about that, but it's definitely better if you know what you're copying than if you don't. I'm not judging if you want to straight up copy-pasta without understanding though... Feel free to do that if you want to ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ 

But if you get caught, remember I told you so.

## [Assignment 1](Assignment%201):

This creates a basic parser for SPICE commands, and stores them in a list format.

## [Assignment 2](Assignment%202):

Adds a very basic SPICE "computing engine" to the code, which is basically just a matrix solver. You'll get it if you got EE2015.

## [Assignment 3](Assignment%203):

You'll learn to use the `lstsq` function in this assignment - it'll be a staple of this course going forward. Learn this well.

## [Assignment 4](Assignment%204):

Fourier Approximations - Use the integrator provided in scipy and compare that with the values we get using `lstsq`. Works like a charm, and at the end of this, you'll know why we don't directly integrate to get a Fourier Series.

Knowledge of Big O helps to properly quantify this, consider reading more about this if you want to understand better.

## [Assignment 5](Assignment%205):

This is one of the coolest assignments in this course.

Here, you'll be simulating a metal plate that has current being supplied to it by a cylindrical rod onto its centre, and the plate is grounded at the bottom edge.

You need to calculate the direction of motion of the currents and the temperature gradient of the plate as it heats up.

Hope you find this one as interesting as I did :)

## [Assignment 6](Assignment%206):

This is also one of the coolest assignments in this course, and is arguably cooler than the previous one.

Here, you'll be simulating a tubelight using electrons and gas particles, and find the distribution of where you should be finding the maximas and the bright spots if you were to ever realise this tubelight in reality.

It's a ton of fun, and if you do the plotting correctly, you'll get a bunch of beautiful looking plots. I even used one of them as my Profile picture on WhatsApp for a while, it was so fun.

## [Assignment 6 (LT)](Assignment%206%20(LT)):

This assignment is based on the Laplace Transform and using the `scipy.signal` module. It teaches you how to work with that module, and also to design basic filters. It should be interesting enough for those of you who like Analog, I guess...

This Assignment is numbered weirdly, and for good reason... In case you're wondering why, it's because the previous Assignment 6 was taken from another year (which had different assignments) and this Assignment 6 is taken from the same set as the remaining assignments that we had so far (1 to 5).

Weird numbering, but it was fun interacting with our TAs on this one.

## [Assignment 7](Assignment%207):

This is again going to be interesting to anyone who likes Analog electronics. It uses Sympy to easily write expressions and simulate circuits using lstsq to solve them using the modified nodal analysis equations.

## [Assignment 8](Assignment%208):

This assignment is based on the Digital Fourier Transform - of Periodic Signals.

You'll get to use a number of different functions from the `numpy.fft` and get to see the behaviour of the fft for a number of different signals.

Helps revise while learning DSP, and you get a real feeling for the subject of Signal Processing through this one.

## [Assignment 9](Assignment%209):

This assignment covers similar stuff as the previous one, except for Non-periodic signals.

You'll gain some interesting insights as you do this one, and even more so if you do it yourself XD

## [Endsem](Endsem):

This is obviously the End-Semester exam question paper, and it contains a lot of interesting code.

I had a lot of fun coding this one, and I learnt how to properly use numpy and reshaping through this.

Very interesting question, and I hope you learn something from it :)

(Also hope that this isn't your Endsem paper xD)
