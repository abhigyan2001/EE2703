## Assignment 4:

Fourier Approximations - Use the integrator provided in scipy and compare that with the values we get using `lstsq`. Works like a charm, and at the end of this, you'll know why we don't directly integrate to get a Fourier Series.

Knowledge of Big O helps to properly quantify this, consider reading more about this if you want to understand better.
