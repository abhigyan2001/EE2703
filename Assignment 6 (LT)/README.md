## Assignment 6 (LT):

This assignment is based on the Laplace Transform and using the `scipy.signal` module. It teaches you how to work with that module, and also to design basic filters. It should be interesting enough for those of you who like Analog, I guess...

This Assignment is numbered weirdly, and for good reason... In case you're wondering why, it's because the previous Assignment 6 was taken from another year (which had different assignments) and this Assignment 6 is taken from the same set as the remaining assignments that we had so far (1 to 5).

Weird numbering, but it was fun interacting with our TAs on this one.
